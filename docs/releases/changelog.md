# Changelog

This page summarizes the English release notes for the local Android app.

For full localized notes, see the Android app repository changelog.

OpenVitals is a Kotlin app. It was rebuilt on Flutter in 2.0.1 and migrated back to Kotlin in 2.5.0, so entries between those two releases describe the Flutter implementation, and everything before and after describes the Kotlin one. (2.0.0 was prepared but never published, so 2.0.1 carries everything since 1.9.0.)

## 2.9.0 - 2026-09-18

This release lets you choose the guideline that names your blood pressure readings - ACC/AHA, ESH, ESC or ISH - and send a point from the phone to a Garmin watch's saved locations. Elevation correction now covers activities recorded on the phone, Garmin watches show ringing calls, older ones such as the original Instinct receive notifications, Russian joins the language picker with every language back at 100%, and a round of fixes removes the freezes behind "app isn't responding".

- **Choose the blood pressure guideline.** The categories were fixed to ACC/AHA 2017, where high starts at 130/80 mmHg; Europe and the ISH start at 140/90. Settings gains a Vitals section with the choice: ACC/AHA 2017, ESH 2023, ESC 2024 or ISH 2020. ACC/AHA stays the default, and every guideline still flags a reading above 180 or above 120. The blood pressure screen gains "How it is classified", which explains how a reading gets its category, lists the thresholds and links the guideline's sources.
- **Send a point to a Garmin watch.** A watch that can store locations gets a "Send a point" row. Type a name and coordinates - decimal degrees, degrees and decimal minutes, or degrees, minutes and seconds - or share a place from a maps app: OpenVitals appears as "Send to watch" for geo: links and shared text, and reads Google Maps, OpenStreetMap and OsmAnd links. A shared place only fills the form; nothing is sent until you tap Send. The watch keeps the point in its saved locations, where it can be picked as a navigation target, and each way the send can fail has its own message. Asked for as Gadgetbridge's "Send Point". Not yet confirmed on a watch.
- **Elevation correction covers phone recordings.** 2.8.0 corrected imported routes only. A GPS activity recorded on the phone now goes through the same correction when it finishes, under the same rule: a route not fully covered by your tiles keeps its own altitudes. The figure shown while recording is still the sensor's; the corrected route and gain land on the review form. The switch is now called "Correct altitude from tiles".
- **Ringing calls on a Garmin watch.** Calls never reached any watch. A ringing call now shows on the wrist with the caller's name and leaves once it is answered. With a dialer that uses Android's call-style notification, the watch's accept and reject buttons work. No phone permission is needed and nothing reads the call log.
- **Notifications on older Garmin watches.** Older watches such as the original Instinct showed nothing. The phone now waits until the watch has declared its capabilities before it sends the start-up sequence, so these watches subscribe for notifications and list their files. A watch that asks what an app is called gets an answer instead of waiting forever. A dismissed notification is always withdrawn from the watch, so phantom entries no longer pile up until nothing new appears.
- **No more "app isn't responding" freezes.** Work that made the main thread wait now runs in the background: home widget refreshes, the quick beverage widget tap (it saves first and updates the tile after), beverage logging, heart rate charts over long periods, and the source labels on lists of readings, which made the Blood pressure screen sluggish. When Android does record a freeze, its trace - thread names and stack frames, no health values - goes into the report email and the debug log export.
- **Russian, and every language at 100%.** Russian joins the language picker, contributed by Xapitonov on Codeberg Translate. Czech, German, Spanish, Estonian, French, Galician, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese and Simplified Chinese are complete again; Italian updates contributed by NeriSal.
- **Fixes:** a night now claims a sleep session that starts before the "Night starts at" hour but spends more than half its span inside the night, so an early bedtime no longer shows as a nap on the evening before while the wake-up date has no sleep; a long Apple Health import error shows its start and points to Copy error or Download full report for the rest.

## 2.8.0 - 2026-09-12

This release corrects the altitude of imported routes from elevation tiles stored on the phone, so a drifting barometer no longer inflates the gain. Workout plans gain sets, weight and rest per exercise, home widgets refresh on an interval you choose, older Garmin watches such as the Instinct 2X now sync, voice cues duck your music, and Body Energy counts respiratory records and holds steady after a heart zone edit.

- **Elevation correction from offline elevation tiles.** Older barometric altimeters drift, so an imported route carries wrong altitude and an inflated gain. Settings > Activities gains Elevation correction: import SRTM .hgt tiles (or a zip holding one) downloaded on a computer, switch on Correct altitude on import, and every route imported from then on - GPX, TCX, KML, KMZ and FIT, whether one file, a folder or a watch sync - takes its altitude from the tiles and has its gain recomputed with the same smoothing a recording uses. A route with even one point outside your tiles keeps the altitudes it came with, and the import log says so. Phone recordings and activities already in Health Connect are untouched. The app downloads nothing; the tile card links to the guide that says where to get them.
- **Sets, weight and rest per exercise in workout plans.** A strength plan such as "lat pulldown, 3 sets of 12 at 50 kg, 2 min rest" took six rows to build. An exercise row now has Sets, Weight (kg) and Rest after each set. Saving unrolls the row so Health Connect and other apps see plain steps; loading folds identical runs back into one row. The weight goes all the way through: the guided run shows and speaks it and its banner adds "Set 2 of 3", the review form prefills it per set so a lighter or heavier set can be corrected before saving, and the workout detail shows a Weight row. Durations can be typed in seconds or minutes, and whole minutes read as "2 min" in the builder, the setup card, the run banner and the voice cues. Older drafts still load.
- **Choose how often home widgets refresh.** 2.7.3 fixed the widgets at every 30 minutes. Settings > Display now offers 15, 30, 60 or 120 minutes; 30 stays the default, and changing it re-plans the running refresh at once. Android decides the exact moment, and shorter intervals use more battery.
- **Older Garmin watches sync too.** Watches on Garmin's older Bluetooth transport, such as the Instinct 2X, used to pair and then fail on their first sync. They now sync and receive forwarded notifications. Live heart rate and step streaming need the newer transport, so such a watch syncs but shows no live readings. Body weight a watch relays from a paired Garmin scale lands in Health Connect. A watch that lists no files on the first try is asked a second way, and a sync cut off midway keeps what arrived and is reported as interrupted so the next sync retries the rest. Contributed by hawk01.
- **Voice announcements duck other audio.** Announcements and plan cues spoke over music at full volume. They now hold audio focus while speaking, so music dips and comes back when the last queued cue ends. Speech is tagged as guidance, so headphones play it on the media stream.
- **Body Energy counts respiratory records and holds steady after a heart zone edit.** The Respiration modifier always said "0 records": the 28-day respiratory baseline was never computed, and the day's records were only read once a baseline existed. Both now work the way HRV does. Changing the zone mode made the score alternate between two values: today opened on the neutral 50 until the history was rebuilt, then jumped back on the next load. Today now keeps its last known value while the rebuild runs, the rebuild starts as soon as the setting is saved, and the dashboard card and detail screen reload once it lands.
- **Fixes:** the adaptive launcher icon, broken on some devices, was redrawn as vectors following Android's guidelines (contributed by Teccheck); imported route gain goes through the same smoothing filter a recording uses instead of a raw sum; German translation updated to 99%, and Polish is progressing on Codeberg Translate.

## 2.7.3 - 2026-09-06

This release estimates sleep stages on the phone for Garmin watches that never record them, such as the Venu SQ, from the heart rate and movement the watch does hand over. Home widgets refresh every 30 minutes, a whole folder of FIT files imports again, the Log screen no longer demands every write permission before it opens, and a Start over button rebuilds Body energy, Recovery and Expenditure from scratch.

- **Sleep stages for Garmin watches that never record them.** Older watches such as the Venu SQ leave sleep staging to Garmin's servers, so their nights synced as nothing at all, or as an awake-only "sleep" session. What such a watch does hand over is a heart rate and a movement count for every minute, and OpenVitals now estimates the night from those on the phone: when sleep began and ended, and a light, deep, REM and awake timeline. One session per night, marked as estimated in its notes and rewritten in place as the night's files arrive over later syncs. A watch that records its own stages is left alone.
- **Home widgets refresh every 30 minutes.** The widgets relied on Android's own update timer, which Doze skips and some phones throttle, so they refreshed a few times a day. They now re-read Health Connect every half hour while at least one is placed, and redraw as soon as the dashboard has loaded today.
- **Import a whole folder of FIT files again.** The folder button on the FIT importer card was lost in the move to Kotlin (2.5.0), leaving only one file at a time. It is back: pick the folder and every FIT file inside it is written straight to Health Connect, sub-folders included, in the order the activities happened. Garmin wellness files in the folder land as nightly HRV. A file that will not read fails on its own and the rest carries on; a very large folder says how many files were taken, and a folder with no FIT files says so instead of erroring.
- **Log without handing over every write permission.** The Log screen used to lock itself until OpenVitals held every Health Connect write permission, even if you only wanted to record your weight. It now opens with any or no write access, and each tile asks Health Connect for just its own permissions when you tap it. Declining still opens the entry form, which offers Grant again whenever you are ready.
- **Onboarding needs only the reads.** Step one used to insist on the Activity and Sleep write permissions as well. Decline every write in the Health Connect dialog and you can still continue; the log asks for a tile's write access when you first use it.
- **Start Body energy, Recovery and Expenditure over.** These are the three metrics OpenVitals works out itself and keeps outside Health Connect, and the only way to make it forget a bad run of them was clearing app data, which takes every preference with it. Settings > Recovery gains a Start over card that wipes exactly that derived set - the history, the tuning learned from your watch, the baselines and the expenditure cache - and rebuilds it from Health Connect behind a confirmation. Health Connect data, body profile, heart zones and goals are kept.
- **One heart rate average per screen.** 2.7.2 corrected the day's heart rate on the dashboard, but the Statistics card on the heart rate detail screen's day view still averaged raw readings, so the same day showed 82 bpm on the dashboard and 116 bpm one tap deeper. That card, the HRV week and month charts and their statistics, the 28-day HRV baseline, the PDF report, the period charts for SpO2, body temperature, glucose and VO2max, respiratory rate and the overview captions all use the corrected averages now.
- **Fixes:** the entry forms ask for missing write access with the same "Some permissions are missing" callout as the rest of the app; the "Manual entry write access" card in Settings now includes heart rate variability, so the HRV tile can be granted from there; saving a vitals or mindfulness entry without write access shows the permission message instead of a raw error; metric detail screens no longer jump while they reload; updated Spanish, Japanese and Galician translations, and Polish is progressing on Codeberg Translate.

## 2.7.2 - 2026-09-02

This release fixes the day's heart numbers: averages now weight each reading by how long it held, so a 50-minute run no longer outvotes the other 23 hours and a day that truly averaged 79 bpm no longer prints as 115. Steps can now be imported from CSV files with an optional end-time column, the quick beverage widget logs again, and a workout plan made on this phone keeps its Edit and Delete entries.

- **A workout no longer skews the day's heart rate.** Averages now weight each reading by how long it held, not by how often the device wrote: a watch records a workout about once a second but the rest of the day about once a minute, so a 50-minute run outvoted the other 23 hours and a day that averaged 79 bpm printed as 115. Heart rate, HRV, respiratory rate, SpO2, the sleep score's overnight HRV and the stress score all use the corrected averages.
- **Steps in the CSV importer.** Steps join the metrics a CSV can bring in. Map an optional "End date and time" column and each row spans from its start to that end; a row without one counts as one minute. A row whose end cannot be read rejects only its steps - the other columns still import - and re-importing the same file replaces rather than duplicates.
- **The quick beverage widget logs again.** Tapping the 1x1 widget or the 2x1's Add button had silently stopped logging in 2.7.0 and 2.7.1.
- **Fixes:** a workout plan created on this phone keeps its Edit and Delete entries even when device sync relabels its source; the dashboard no longer shifts down while a sync runs; updated Czech, Spanish, French, Portuguese and Simplified Chinese translations, and Finnish and Polish have begun on Codeberg Translate.

## 2.7.1 - 2026-08-30

This release is about training with a plan. Build a routine once - blocks of exercises with reps or seconds, rests, and rounds - and start it as a guided run: the phone counts push-ups and squats with its proximity sensor where it can, timed steps and rests count down on a ring and move on by themselves, and every step is spoken and shown in the notification. Plans live in Health Connect, so one made in another app can be started too. Any workout can now be exported without its route as TCX, FIT or CSV, every language the picker offers is complete, and a nap from a Garmin watch finally counts as sleep.

- **Workout plans.** Build a routine once - blocks of exercises with a reps or seconds goal, rests, and rounds - and start it from the activity screen as a guided run: Step 2 of 6, reps counted against the goal, timed steps and rests counting down on a ring that empties clockwise, a spoken cue at every step, and the same progress in the notification. Plans live in Health Connect as planned exercise sessions, grouped as today, upcoming and past; one made in another app can be started or copied to today, a logged workout can be saved as a plan, and a saved workout keeps a link to the plan it came from.
- **Reps counted by the phone in a plan.** A plan step finds the same recognizer the single-exercise recording uses: push-ups and squats on the proximity sensor, pull-ups, rope skipping and trampoline jumping on the accelerometer. Squats are new to the proximity sensor, in plans and on their own, and a step named "Pushups", "push ups" or by the exercise's name in the phone's language counts as well as "Push-ups" does.
- **Workouts export without their route.** Every workout detail screen carries an Export workout card: type, times, duration, distance, calories and heart rate as TCX, FIT or CSV, with the GPS route deliberately left out - for sessions that never had one too.
- **Every language is complete.** Czech, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Estonian, Portuguese and Simplified Chinese are fully translated, workout plans and exercise names included.
- **Naps count as sleep.** A nap synced from a Garmin watch arrived with no stages and read as "nothing recorded"; it is recorded as light sleep now, as Gadgetbridge does. On the night's timeline the out-of-bed stretch takes a dusty rose in the Awake family instead of a brown, and Share of time in bed gets an Out of bed row.
- **Fixes:** a night Mi Fitness stores as overlapping records no longer shows 13h on the detail screen for 8h of stages; the rest countdown beeps for five seconds rather than three; the plan controls no longer wrap their labels mid-word.

## 2.7.0 - 2026-08-26

This release is about the app answering questions it used to leave to the user: the daily goal card says how far ahead or behind a week is and what each remaining day needs, offline maps rotate and follow the recording, the summary opens at once and fills tile by tile, a Garmin sync no longer tells the watch to drop data it never received, and the app speaks Simplified Chinese.

- **Goal balance and per-day catch-up.** The daily goal card on the activity screens now says how far ahead or behind the week is - not just how many days hit the goal - and what each remaining day needs to average for it to land on goal, today included. The statistics grid gets a Goal balance tile. Days with nothing logged count as zero, and the sign stays in your favour whichever way the goal points.
- **Maps rotate and follow the recording.** Both offline renderers take two-finger rotation, with a compass to reset north whenever the map is off it. While recording, the camera keeps the live fix centred; panning hands control to you, and the recenter button hands it back.
- **The summary opens at once.** The dashboard no longer waits on a batch of Health Connect reads before drawing anything - it renders with every tile loading and fills each one as its own read lands. A throttled Health Connect shows a fallback and says how long to wait instead of holding a spinner for minutes.
- **The app speaks Simplified Chinese.** A full translation, offered by the in-app language picker.
- **The recording screen leads with its tabs,** CoMaps guidance lives on the map tab, and Start asks before starting without a route instead of refusing with a toast. The sleep day view drops the averages of a single night and the key-metric cards that restated the chart.
- **Fixes:** a Garmin sync never tells the watch to drop a file it did not download, which was costing a day and a half of heart rate and steps; the recording screen's app bar - title, dashboard editor, outdoor toggle - is back, and focus and outdoor mode reach the whole screen; the bottom bar is pure black under AMOLED; and large Apple Health exports no longer run out of memory.

## 2.6.6 - 2026-08-22

This release is about the watch earning its place without a recording running: CoMaps guidance now reaches a Garmin watch on its own switch, a newly paired watch keeps the link its features depend on, a caffeinated drink can be logged over the time it took, and the app speaks French.

- **CoMaps guidance reaches the watch on its own.** The next turn, the distance to it and the street appear on a Garmin watch whenever CoMaps is navigating, as a notification that updates in place. It has its own per-watch switch and is now separate from the activity recording integration: either one alone works, both together show in both places. Starting a GPS recording just to get directions on your wrist is no longer the price of admission.
- **A drink can be logged over the time it took.** The Log drink dialog asks how long a caffeinated drink took - at once, 15 or 30 minutes, 1, 2 or 3 hours - and stores it as the nutrition record's end time. Every drink used to be a one-second record, so a coffee nursed over two hours spiked at the first sip; it now spreads across those hours.
- **The app speaks French.** A full translation, offered by the in-app language picker.
- **New watches stay connected.** Stay connected is now on by default - on a newly paired watch, and on an existing one whose switch was never touched. Weather, find-my-phone, live heart rate and steps, a recording handed over the moment it ends, and guidance on the wrist all need the link, and a watch with none of it working gave no hint that one switch was the reason. It costs battery on both sides, and turning it off is remembered.
- **Fixes:** an activity synced from a Garmin watch now keeps the title given on the wrist; and a multi-hour ride no longer fails to import - its GPS route could exceed the size Health Connect accepts for one record, and took the whole sync down with it.


## 2.6.5 - 2026-08-19

This release is about the app doing its job without being watched: a Garmin watch can now sync itself on a schedule, phone-to-phone sync handles years of data and explains its failures, and a night slept in two goes stops booking the time out of bed as time awake.

- **The watch syncs itself.** A new Automatic sync setting syncs a Garmin watch on its own every 30 minutes, hour, or two hours - off by default and chosen per watch. Runs are quiet: a watch out of range at 3am is not an error, and the last sync time is what says the schedule is working. Android picks the exact moment, so the battery-optimization exemption offered during pairing is what keeps overnight runs on time.
- **The app speaks Czech.** A full translation, offered by the in-app language picker.
- **Notes on mindfulness sessions.** The timer and the manual entry form take a note, stored in Health Connect with the session. The list keeps notes behind a tap, and editing a session can change or clear its note.
- **Beers in the beverage catalogue.** Beer, lager, pilsner, stout, and alcohol-free beer, with nutrition filled in and honest hydration credit - an alcoholic beer counts less than its volume.
- **Sync with another phone handles years of data and slow links.** The transfer now streams instead of loading the whole library into memory, batches are capped by size on the wire so sample-heavy records cross a slow Bluetooth link before the other side gives up, and a Health Connect rate-limit pause no longer kills the session. When a sync does fail, the screen says why and how far it got, with the report ready to copy or share - and a transfer that lost records on the way no longer claims it completed.
- **Time out of bed is no longer time awake.** A night slept in two goes counted the get-up as awake - a 90-minute get-up read as 1h38m awake - dragging down sleep efficiency and the sleep score. The gap is now its own out-of-bed segment in both sleep charts, in a colour no sleep stage uses.
- **Fixes:** the mindfulness year heatmap shows the whole last twelve months instead of stopping at the calendar year; and mindfulness entries recorded by the old app no longer show the word "null" as a note.

## 2.6.4 - 2026-08-13

This release is about numbers that were technically correct and told you nothing: a battery that charged a broken night like a perfect one, a month of weight drawn as near-identical coloured dots, a nutrition total nobody eats by, and a step count short of what the watch had actually recorded.

- **Body Energy tells a good night from a bad one.** Overnight charge now reflects how well you slept - sleep efficiency, time spent awake, and the deep and REM share of the night - and not only how long you were in bed. Two eight-hour nights of very different quality used to land within a few points of each other; they now sit about fifteen apart. An ordinary night charges exactly what it did before, the effect is capped so no single night can undo hours you actually slept, and a sleep source that records no stages is left alone.
- **Weight is a line, not a calendar.** Week, month and year now draw body measurements as a trend line on a scale fitted to your values, instead of a calendar of coloured dots. A calendar shades a day by how big its number is, which says nothing about a weight that lives inside a two-kilo band.
- **Nutrition shows what you eat in a day, not in a month.** Over a week, month or year each nutrient tile leads with the daily average and keeps the period total underneath. A new Nutrition setting chooses whether the average divides by the days you logged food or by every day of the period.
- **Fixes:** Garmin step counts no longer come up short - overlapping step records were being partly discarded, so a day could read 889 steps when the watch had recorded 1,007; an entry list keeps how far you expanded it after you swipe an entry away; maximum heart rate is no longer invented from a quiet fortnight, and an estimated figure now says it is estimated; the cardio load target no longer reports impossible percentages; and chart date labels no longer arrive cut in half.

## 2.6.3 - 2026-08-12

This release is about the watch feeling paired, not just synced: a Garmin watch can now stay connected whenever it is in range, and that held link carries live readings, weather, your calendar, find-my-phone, and GPS ephemeris - all without the app gaining any internet access.

- **Your Garmin watch can stay connected.** A new Stay connected switch keeps the Bluetooth link open whenever the watch is in range, the way the vendor's app does. With it on, an optional Live readings switch streams the watch's current heart rate and step count - shown live on the watch screen and the dashboard. Both are off by default.
- **A watch tile on the dashboard.** The most recently synced watch, with its battery, last sync time, and a sync button. While live readings stream, the tile shows the current heart rate and steps instead.
- **Weather, calendar, and find-my-phone on the watch.** The weather glance is answered from a weather app on the phone (Breezy Weather is the tested one). The calendar glance can show the phone's upcoming events, off by default behind its own permission. And the watch's find-my-phone rings the phone, even when silenced.
- **Faster GPS fixes.** Import a satellite prediction (ephemeris) file and the phone hands it over when the watch asks, turning a minutes-long cold GPS fix into seconds. Nothing is downloaded.
- **Grant all permissions at once.** The first onboarding screen gets a Grant all button that requests every category in one dialog.
- **Sleep score rebuilt on sleep-science pillars.** Duration, quality, and overnight HRV recovery are scored using published sleep guidance, with age and night HRV feeding the score, recovery, and the dashboard.
- **Fixes:** cardio load and intensity minutes read workout heart rate instead of falling back to movement; body tiles open their own metric screens directly; the syncing banner is no longer clipped; a smartwatch added through the sensors flow stays a plain sensor; diagnostics exports include raw process logs.

## 2.6.2 - 2026-08-08

This release lets a reading into the app that no wearable took: HRV can now be logged by hand, and every hand-logged vitals reading can carry the moment it was actually taken.

- **Log HRV manually.** Heart rate variability joins the Log screen: enter an RMSSD value in ms and it is written to Health Connect, feeding the dashboard tile, the HRV screen, and baselines like any watch reading. Your own entries can be edited and deleted from the HRV day view; the tile can be removed in the Log screen's edit mode.
- **Pick the time on new entries.** Every vitals entry form - blood pressure, SpO2, respiratory rate, body temperature, HRV - now offers date and time pickers when adding, not only when editing. A reading taken this morning can be logged tonight under its real clock; the pickers default to now.
- **Fixes:** switching days on the dashboard answers instantly - the date flips at once, tiles show a loading state instead of the previous day's numbers, and the rings sweep in exactly once with the right values; the small weekly cardio tile no longer says "Loading" forever next to the cardio ring; returning from a metric screen keeps the widget page and scroll position; the hydration day graph no longer ends in a dot - dots mark entries only; a sleep window set within one day (such as 00:00 to 12:00) files each night on its own date.

## 2.6.1 - 2026-08-06

This release puts a navigator next to the recorder: with a CoMaps build that shares its navigation, a GPS recording shows the guidance you are actually following while OpenVitals keeps recording. CoMaps plans and navigates; OpenVitals reads and records.

- **Live CoMaps navigation while recording.** The next turn floats over the live map, the planned route is drawn point-for-point on the offline map with turn arrows and a destination flag, and the location dot becomes a compass arrow that points where the phone points. With the integration on, Start becomes a doorway - set the route up in CoMaps or dismiss the guidance card, then start. Guidance shown during the ride can be kept with the saved activity - on this device only, never in Health Connect. Off by default under Settings > Activity recording.
- **One launcher icon.** The release build ships the artwork the debug build had; debug keeps the shape and differs only in colour.
- **Fixes:** with 3-button system navigation the bar no longer covers the bottom of screens; heart and vitals tiles open their own metric screens instead of a shared overview; the swipe-to-delete red no longer shows through entry rows at rest; one reload shows one indicator, and dashboard widgets replay their animations only when a reload actually brought new data.

## 2.6.0 - 2026-08-05

This release is about the two conversations your health data has outside the app: with your doctor, and with you. A PDF report you can hand across a desk, menstrual cycle tracking that lives entirely in Health Connect, and blood-pressure logging that captures what clinicians actually ask about a reading.

- **Menstrual cycle tracking.** Log period flow, spotting, sexual activity, ovulation tests, cervical mucus and basal body temperature - one category at a time, each its own Health Connect record. Period days derive from your flow entries, and cycle statistics predict the next period; when cycles vary too much for an honest prediction, the app says so. Cycle data stays a separately granted permission category and is stored only in Health Connect.
- **Health report export (PDF).** Pick metrics, detail level and range, and OpenVitals builds a PDF on the device to share or save - charts, statistics and tables per metric, and clinical sections where the data has more to say: blood pressure with separate systolic/diastolic statistics and meal-context averages, glucose by relation to meal with fasting first, workouts by activity type with the full session list, and sleep with bedtime/wake-up averages and the stage mix. The report states its own gaps in print.
- **Richer blood-pressure logging.** Optional dropdowns for when the reading was taken, body position and cuff location, plus a collapsible guide with the standard home-measurement protocol.
- **Distance backfill from steps.** Opt-in under Activities: your stride length fills daily distance only for days that have steps and no distance from any source; derived records are marked and removed if you turn it off.
- **Portuguese added,** and Spanish, Italian, Estonian and German are complete again at 100%.
- **The dashboard keeps tiles with recent history.** A tile only sinks when its metric has no data today and none recently - Sleep no longer drops before tonight - and a "Sort empty tiles last" toggle makes it a choice.
- **Fixes:** year-long heart-rate reads are chunked so they cannot come back empty; duplicated blood-pressure records count once in the report; cycle screens allow screenshots; the base unit option is named "System" everywhere.

## 2.5.0 - 2026-08-04

OpenVitals is native Kotlin again. Every feature the 2.x line added has been rebuilt on the Android-native app; your data and settings from the previous version are imported automatically the first time you open it.

- **Smartwatches sync through Health Connect.** OpenVitals does not pair with watches: Gadgetbridge or your vendor's app syncs the watch into Health Connect and OpenVitals reads everything there - steps, heart rate, HRV, sleep and workouts - with the original source shown on each record. Bluetooth sensors are unaffected and still stream live into recordings.
- **Sync health data with another phone over Bluetooth.** Both phones stay offline - no account, no internet at any point - and records keep their original source across the transfer.
- **Import health data from CSV files** through a guided wizard that maps your own columns.
- **Units that follow your device.** The unit setting defaults to Android's measurement-system preference, and every quantity can override it on its own.
- **Sturdier reminders,** quick-add from the notification, GPS-free recording, a guided heart-rate recovery test, TCX and indoor-workout import, more accurate elevation, and a long list of fixes - see the app repository changelog for the full notes.

## 2.4.0 - 2026-07-28

Onboarding is rebuilt from the ground up, the dashboard stops nagging about permissions, and the whole app gets a quiet visual tune-up: consistently outlined icons and Material 3 text spacing.

- **Onboarding is now a four-step guide.** Permissions are grouped the way Health Connect itself groups them - Activity, Body measurements, Nutrition, Sleep, Vitals - so the row you tap and the system dialog it opens carry the same name. One tap per category asks to read *and* to save, so entries you create in OpenVitals go back to Health Connect. Only Activity and Sleep are required to start; everything else is optional and can be added later from Settings.
- **Mindfulness and cycle tracking are opt-in steps.** Mindfulness stays off unless you switch it on - some Health Connect versions crash their own permission screen when asked for it, so OpenVitals requests it alone, where it can't take anything else down. Cycle tracking is its own step with a plain description of what it covers, and a Not now.
- **Exercise routes get a walkthrough.** Reading route maps is the one permission Android hides behind Health Connect's *Additional access* page, out of reach of any app. If it's still missing after the Activity grant, the last step shows the three taps that finish it, with a button that lands one tap away.
- **The dashboard no longer asks for permissions.** The two prompt cards that used to stack on the home screen right after onboarding are gone. A metric without access simply shows no data; screens ask at the point of use instead.
- **Icons are consistently outlined** - the same glyph no longer appears filled on one screen and outlined on another - and **text spacing now follows Material 3**, restoring the letter-spacing the body and title styles had silently lost in the Flutter port.
- **OpenVitals never asks for a permission your device cannot grant.** Requests are filtered against what the installed Health Connect provider defines *and* what the app itself declares - the combination that could crash the system Health Connect app on some de-Googled ROMs, locking users out of granting anything at all. This also fixes phone-to-phone sync demanding a skin-temperature write permission that could never be granted.

The permission model is versioned: existing installs pass through the new onboarding once, then continue to the dashboard as usual. Nothing already granted is asked for again.

## 2.3.2 - 2026-07-25

A small release for the activity screen: the offline route map stops freezing and crashing, PMTiles packs actually draw their map, and the route export from the pre-Flutter app is back.

- **Export a workout's route again.** The route card on an activity got its buttons back from the pre-Flutter app: open the route in a map app, save it as GPX, or save it as KMZ. Files are named after the activity and its start time, and the save goes through the system save dialog so you pick where it lands.
- **Offline maps no longer freeze the activity screen - or crash the app.** With a Mapsforge pack active, scrolling to the map could hold the whole screen for seconds while tiles were prepared, and past five seconds Android kills the app as unresponsive. Tiles are now read and prepared in the background, so the screen stays smooth while the map draws in.
- **PMTiles packs draw their base map again.** An imported .pmtiles pack rendered nothing but the plain background behind the route; the vector base map now appears as it should.

## 2.3.1 - 2026-07-24

A polish release about honesty at the edges: the day boundary, the year view, and the hours your tracker spends off your wrist. Widgets stop freezing overnight, mornings show last night's vitals instead of "No data", Body Energy keeps living while the watch charges, and a Garmin Edge can now be a live sensor and a sync device at once.

- **A Garmin Edge can be two things at once.** A bike computer now broadcasts as a live sensor during a recording - heart rate, speed, cadence, power, the way a strap does - while still syncing its recorded rides afterwards. WearOS smartwatches are also recognised as their own device type, with a Health Connect sources card in diagnostics.
- **Widgets stop freezing overnight and ask for what they need.** The refresh alarm survives Android's battery saving, placing a widget offers the "Alarms & reminders" permission that keeps refreshes on schedule (declining keeps the widget), and widgets refresh the moment a watch sync or an Apple Health import lands new data.
- **Body Energy keeps living while the tracker is off.** Once the day has shown any data, baseline metabolism keeps draining through the gaps, and a walk recorded by the phone's own step counter drains too. Untracked days hold steady rather than sliding to zero.
- **Mornings show last night.** HRV, resting heart rate, respiratory rate, SpO2 and skin temperature read from your night window, so the dashboard has your overnight values at breakfast instead of "No data" until the first daytime sample.
- **Caffeine and streak fixes.** The bedtime projection describes the night ahead, the dashboard tile shows the caffeine active right now with today's intake beneath it, goal streaks survive midnight until the day genuinely fails, and a drink just before midnight still anchors the hydration reminder schedule.
- **The Calories year view tells the truth.** No more doubled and missing days around the clock changes, no phantom kilocalories in empty years, no piling up reads until the screen hangs when paging quickly through years.
- **Garmin sleep stages sit where they happened,** intensity minutes count the whole week toward the weekly goal, and every top-level screen survives the largest text size.

## 2.3.0 - 2026-07-22

> **Note:** The direct watch connectivity described below (watch pairing, sync, alarms, and on-watch settings) has since been removed from OpenVitals. Watches now sync into Health Connect through Gadgetbridge or the vendor's app — see [Smartwatches](../features/smartwatches.md). Bluetooth LE sensors and phone-to-phone sync remain.

The biggest release so far. OpenVitals can now read a Garmin watch directly over Bluetooth - no Garmin account, no Connect app - and copy your health records to another phone the same way. Body Energy gets a plot on your home screen, sleep gets a night window you set yourself, and the Calories year view that used to take half a minute now opens straight away.

- **Garmin watch sync.** Pair a Garmin watch and copy what it recorded straight off the wrist over Bluetooth. Sleep, heart rate, HRV, VO2 max, SpO2, respiration, steps, distance and workouts go to Health Connect; the measures Health Connect has no place for - stress, Body Battery, intensity minutes, training readiness, recovery time and training load - are kept in the app and shown on a Watch data screen. Nothing goes through Garmin's servers, and the app still has no internet permission.
- **Your watch's alarms and settings, from your phone.** Switch alarms on and off, retime, rename, add and delete them, and browse the watch's own settings menus - all read live from the watch, in the language the watch is set to. There is also a Find button to make the watch alert when you have mislaid it.
- **Sync with another phone.** Copy Health Connect records to a nearby phone over Bluetooth, with no account and no internet. All 41 record types are supported, the two phones pair with a code you confirm on both, and a report tells you exactly what moved.
- **Body Energy on your home screen.** The Body Energy widget draws the day's curve beside the score. Sleep also gets a night window you set yourself, replacing the fixed range modes.
- **Much faster everywhere.** The Calories year view opens immediately instead of taking up to half a minute, the dashboard reads its metrics concurrently, the charts stop repainting every frame, and a recording no longer writes every sensor event to disk as it arrives.
- **Fixes.** A partly-staged night draws whole and merged nights open their detail; a day's steps are no longer doubled by syncing twice; reminders survive a long absence; reading the log and importing a route file no longer freeze the app; floors, elevation and wheelchair pushes land in the right period; and widgets show fresh data after the background isolate is reused.

## 2.2.8 - 2026-07-20

This release adds heart-rate recovery, rebuilds hydration and mindfulness reminders so they survive an app update rather than only a reboot, and ties the numbers on screen to the research behind them. It also fixes a Calories screen that could hang and a 30-day calendar that only drew part of the month.

- **Heart-rate recovery.** A guided test measures how quickly your heart rate falls in the minute after exertion. Recovery also appears on a workout, and is tracked over weeks and months, read from the samples Health Connect already holds. It is measured only from a deliberate test now, so a heart rate that rose after exercise is no longer misreported as a recovery.
- **Reminders that survive an app update.** Hydration and mindfulness reminders were rebuilt from the ground up so they keep firing after every update, not just after a reboot. Hydration nudges now anchor to your last drink — the countdown resets each time you log one, and is skipped if you drank recently — and fire on the exact minute when you allow exact alarms.
- **Every number shows its science.** The sleep, daily-readiness, body-energy, cardio-load and caffeine screens carry tappable links to the research behind their calculations. The sleep goal also counts only the time you were actually asleep, so awake time inside a sleep session no longer counts toward it.
- **Tap a day in the month calendar to open it.** On any metric's month view, tapping a day drops you straight into that day's detail. You can also read the time off the sleep hypnogram by scrubbing across it, and it steps aside when a night is only partly staged instead of drawing a misleading graph.
- **The Calories Day view could hang on its loading spinner forever** on some phones; it no longer does. The "Last 30 days" calendar now shows all thirty days across a month boundary instead of only the part that fell in one calendar month, and a past 30-day window is titled by its dates rather than a single month it mostly is not in.
- **The sleep score and sleep efficiency detail screens are reachable again**, and the sleep day view no longer draws the hypnogram over its own labels, drops stats that did not belong there, and calls the duration "time in bed".
- **Recording fixes.** A workout could fail to save because it never asked to write its own heart rate; a session could end before its last sample; and your own edits now show immediately, writing through the daily cache instead of waiting for the next sync.
- Spanish, German, Estonian and Italian are fully translated.

## 2.2.7 - 2026-07-17

A maintenance release that brings back editing and deleting your own entries, makes large Apple Health imports dramatically faster with a working report at the end, and fixes the sleep chart, the workout rest bell and the hydration widget.

- **Editing and deleting the entries you logged in the app works again.** Swipe a hydration, nutrition, caffeine or mindfulness entry to delete it, tap the pencil to edit a hydration or mindfulness entry, and edit or delete an activity from its detail screen. Only entries OpenVitals wrote are editable; records from other apps stay read-only. These were lost when the app moved to Flutter.
- **Large Apple Health imports are dramatically faster.** The per-batch duplicate check is bounded to the batch's own time window instead of scanning your whole history on every batch, which grew slower and slower as the import went on. The report you can copy or save when it finishes works again too: a big export's report reaches tens of megabytes, which the previous store could not hold, so it is now written to a file.
- **The workout rest-timer bell ducks your music or podcast for the chime** instead of stopping it, then restores it to full volume.
- **Logging a drink from the 1x1 home-screen widget clears an active hydration reminder**, the same as logging it inside the app.
- **The sleep chart no longer looks broken.** The day view no longer draws its stage graph over its own lane labels at larger system font sizes, and a day that includes a nap keeps the same rounded bars as every other day in the month view.

## 2.2.6 - 2026-07-17

The largest release since the Flutter rebuild. Large Apple Health exports import without running out of memory, Garmin FIT files import from a folder, and the long-range overviews are much faster.

- **Importing a large Apple Health export no longer runs out of memory.** The export is now read a piece at a time instead of loaded whole, so a multi-gigabyte file that used to crash a minute or two into the analysis now imports. Re-importing the same export no longer creates duplicate entries either — the identifier each record is matched on is stable again, so records you already imported are recognised instead of written twice.
- **Body Energy.** A new screen that scores how much energy your body signals support today, from recovery-side inputs — sleep, heart-rate variability, resting heart rate, physiological stress, temperature, hydration, nutrition and mindfulness — on a 0-100 scale, and calibrates to how you say you feel.
- **Garmin FIT files import from a folder.** Point the importer at a Garmin export and it reads sleep, heart-rate variability, resting heart rate and basal metabolic rate. Files it cannot map are reported as skipped rather than failing the whole import.
- **The Year and other long-range overviews are much faster.** They keep a local cache of daily summaries and update only what changed since the last sync, instead of re-reading a year of records every time you open them.
- **Sleep is more accurate.** Daytime naps are separated from the night, and overlapping sessions recorded by more than one source — a watch and a phone logging the same night — are de-duplicated instead of double-counted.
- **Charts pinch to zoom on every range**, and the zoom keeps working while you scroll the page.

## 2.2.5 - 2026-07-14

The download now says which phone it is for.

- **The APKs on the releases page are named after the architecture they are for.** 2.2.4 split the download in two, one per architecture, but named them after an internal version code, which tells you nothing about which one your phone wants. They are now clearly labelled `arm64-v8a` and `armeabi-v7a`. Take the arm64-v8a one unless you know your phone is an older 32-bit device; F-Droid and the Play Store still pick for you. The app inside each APK is byte-for-byte what 2.2.4 shipped.

## 2.2.4 - 2026-07-14

Half the download, and none of it for a phone you do not have.

- **The APK no longer carries libraries for architectures your phone cannot run.** Every download held both builds of the app — the 64-bit one and the 32-bit one — so whichever phone you have, half of what you downloaded was for somebody else's. It also held a third set of libraries, for x86_64, that could never have run at all. There is now one APK per architecture, containing only its own, and the download falls from 60 MB to 34. The releases page offers two APKs: nearly every phone made in the last decade wants the arm64-v8a one, and armeabi-v7a is there for older 32-bit devices. F-Droid and the Play Store pick the right one on their own.

## 2.2.3 - 2026-07-13

The last of the Google out of the build.

- **Google's dependency blob is no longer stamped into the APK.** Android's build tools quietly attach a block to every APK they sign: a list of every library the app was built from, encrypted with a Google key so that only the Play Store can read it. It survived the removal of Google Play Services because it is not a dependency at all — it is added at the moment of signing, after everything else is done. It is gone from the APK now. The app bundle uploaded to Play keeps it, because that is the one place it is actually read.

## 2.2.2 - 2026-07-13

The second half of what 2.2.1 started. 2.2.1 took Google's proprietary code out of the app so that F-Droid could build it; this one makes the build reproducible, which is what F-Droid needs in order to ship it.

- **The app now builds bit-for-bit identically on someone else's computer.** F-Droid does not take our word for what is in the APK: it builds the app from source on its own servers and compares the result, byte by byte, against the release published here, and only distributes the copy we signed if the two match. Everything already matched except twenty bytes in one library: a build-id, a hash the linker stamps in that silently records the paths of the machine that did the build. It is no longer stamped, so the app you download is provably the one the source produces.

## 2.2.1 - 2026-07-13

A packaging release, and a short one. OpenVitals no longer contains a line of Google proprietary code, which is what it takes for F-Droid to build it.

- **Google Play Services are gone from the app.** The location plugin depended on Google's proprietary location library, and the app never used it. Route recording has always asked Android's own location manager for satellite fixes directly, because Google's fused provider quietly mixes in network and wifi positions that are not the GPS readings a recorded route is actually made of. So the library sat in every build being nothing but a dependency, and it was the one thing standing between OpenVitals and F-Droid, whose scanner refuses to build an app that carries it. Nothing about recording changes.

## 2.2.0 - 2026-07-13

This release is about the charts. Every one of them was a picture you could look at and not ask anything of: you could see that the line went up somewhere in the afternoon, and no way to ask when, or how much. The numbers were in the data and never on the screen. They answer now.

- **Drag a chart to read it.** A crosshair follows your finger, a ring marks the sample, and a tooltip gives the value and the time it was taken. It snaps to a reading that was actually measured, never to a point the app invented between two of them — the curve between two readings is an interpolation, and a tooltip may only report a number that was really recorded.
- **The caffeine curve has a scale at last.** It drew the decay of caffeine in a body with no axes and no way to tell when any of it happened. It now reads milligrams down the side and midnight to midnight along the bottom, with a dashed line for the level to be under by bedtime, and a tick under each drink, so every rise sits above the drink that caused it.
- **Charts draw themselves in** — the line left to right, the bars up out of the axis, the ring round to its value. It is not decoration: it is the chart telling you which way to read it. If you have asked your phone to reduce motion, they are simply there, fully drawn.
- **Charts load into a chart-shaped skeleton instead of a spinner**, so the page no longer jumps when the data arrives. And an empty chart now looks like an empty chart, with an icon and a sentence, instead of a stray line of grey text.
- **New chart colours.** Eight of the seventeen metric accents were too faint to see against the background — gold scored 1.59:1 where 3:1 is the floor for a graphical object you are meant to see. Every accent clears it now, and keeps the hue it has always had: steps are still green, water is still blue, the heart is still rose.
- **Body Energy could draw a score above 100**, or below the lowest reading of the day, on a score defined as 0 to 100. The curve can no longer leave the range of the data it was drawn from, and it gained the 0-100 scale it never had.
- An axis could label two different heights with the same number, and a chart could fill the area under a line that was not there. Both fixed.
- German, Estonian and Italian said route import took GPX/KML/KMZ, while the app has read TCX since 2.1.0 — the one file type an indoor athlete would look for was the one those languages said it could not read. German, Spanish, Estonian and Italian are now complete.

## 2.1.0 - 2026-07-13

This release is about the activities the app was throwing away. A treadmill run, a trainer ride, a strength session — anything recorded without GPS — was refused at the door as a broken file. It was not broken. It had no route, and the app had quietly decided those were the same thing.

- **Import a whole folder of FIT files.** Pick the folder; every FIT file inside it is imported, including the ones in the sub-folders where a watch buries them. A file that will not read fails on its own and the rest of the folder carries on.
- **TCX files are now read** — the format Strava and Garmin actually export an indoor activity as, and one the app could not open at all. It is XML, so it used to fall through to the GPX reader, which found no track and blamed the file.
- **Indoor activities could not be imported.** A FIT file records *total* calories and has no active-calorie field, so the app filled the blank with an estimate — and stood that estimate next to the number the file had actually measured. A treadmill run arrived as 226 estimated active calories against its own recorded 208 total, and Health Connect refuses a record whose total is below its active. A guess was allowed to contradict a measurement. It is now estimate both or estimate neither.
- **An indoor bike ride imported as a run.** The app decided what an activity was by mashing the sport, the name and the *file name* into one string and testing "run" before "cycling" — so `Indoor_CyclingiSmoothRun.fit` was read as a run, and a 27 km ride was saved as one. The file's own sport is now asked first, and on its own. A stationary bike is also an activity type of its own at last, so a trainer ride is no longer saved as an outdoor one.
- **A GPX with no locations in it was refused.** Real exporters write indoor sessions as track points carrying a time, a heart rate and no coordinates at all — 1,931 of them for a strength session, in one of the files this was fixed against. The session was in the file the whole time: the timestamps give the start, the end and the duration, and the extensions give the heart rate.
- **A GPX with a heart rate in it lost the heart rate**, and imported as a bare line on a map.
- **Activities show an elevation profile** — where you climbed, not just how much. Health Connect stores one total for a session, so it can tell you that you climbed 240 m and never where; the profile is drawn from the route's own altitudes.
- **A speed graph appears even when the device recorded no speed**, which is most watches. It is rebuilt from the splits, which knew each segment's distance and duration all along, and drawn as a step — one flat run per split, because that is the resolution those numbers really have.

## 2.0.4 - 2026-07-12

The app's insides were rebuilt this release, and the rebuild is what found the bugs. Moving every calculation out of the screens that were doing it mid-draw put a lot of arithmetic side by side for the first time — and several numbers, it turned out, disagreed with each other.

- **The sleep card called your watch's recordings "hand-typed", and never noticed the ones that really were.** Health Connect labels how a record was made — actively recorded, automatically recorded, typed in by a person — and the data-confidence card was checking that label against the wrong value. It warned you about manual entries whenever your watch had recorded the night properly, and a night you genuinely did type in was never counted at all.
- **The hydration goal bar filled up if you logged a single day.** It measured the average of the days you *logged* against your goal — so a week in which you logged Monday, hit your target and never opened the app again showed a completely full bar, with "1 of 1 days met" above it. Log nothing and you cannot fall short of anything. It now counts the days you met your goal against the days that have actually happened, and stops at today.
- **A day's heart rate could print an average outside its own low and high.** The average came from Health Connect's summary of the day while the low and the high came from the individual readings — two different sets of numbers printed as one. All three now come from the readings.
- **The skin-temperature card went blank while its own chart carried on drawing.** A reading that arrives without a temperature difference emptied the card while the chart underneath it plotted the readings that had one.
- **Respiratory rate showed two different averages on one screen**, and said neither which was which: the average of your days under the chart, the average of every reading on the card below it.
- **An Apple Health import that failed on permissions offered no way to fix it.** The "grant permission" button could never appear, because a permission failure was never reported as one.
- **Screens could spin forever after a failed permission check** — on the dashboard, in onboarding, and while saving an activity, the error was thrown where nothing was listening.
- **The app was rebuilt on Flutter's app-architecture guidelines.** Every screen now works out what to show once, when its data loads, rather than recalculating charts, totals and statistics on every redraw while you scroll. It is invisible if it went well, which is the point — and it is the groundwork for iOS.

## 2.0.3 - 2026-07-12

- **An activity could show no heart rate at all, and its splits fell back to estimates.** Health Connect stores heart rate, speed and cadence as *series* records — one record holding many timestamped samples — and filters them by the boundary of the record, never by the times of the samples inside it. A device may group a whole day of beats into a single record, and a 36-minute workout sitting inside one was therefore invisible: the read succeeded and returned nothing, so the activity reported "Not available" for a heart rate it had recorded the entire time. The same read backs the speed samples, so the 1 km splits quietly dropped to being estimated from the average on exactly the same activities.
- **The sleep graphs were blank.** The night's stage timeline and the "share of time in bed" bars drew their coloured bands with zero height — beside durations and percentages that were correct all along.
- **The weekly activities view lost the strip showing which days you trained.** It is back.
- **Beverages logged from a home-screen widget were silently dropped.** The release build strips code it cannot see being used, and the widget's buttons are found by reflection at the moment you tap them — so the tap did nothing and the drink was never recorded.
- **A strength session was cut into distance splits.** A phone left on a bench picks up a couple of hundred metres of GPS drift, and a lifting session was sliced into "1.0 km" and "181 m" laps at a 30:29 min/km pace. Whether an activity has splits is now a question about the kind of activity, not about whether a distance happens to exist for it.
- **Focus mode now fills the screen.** It was rendering under an app bar whose Back arrow did exactly what focus mode's own exit button — and the system back gesture — already do. The height it was taking now goes to the metrics.

## 2.0.2 - 2026-07-12

- **A walk or run recorded by a watch now shows its steps, distance, calories and elevation.** A watch writes an activity as a session carrying little more than a duration, and puts those numbers in *separate* Health Connect records covering the same window — so the activity's page reported "Not available" for figures the watch had in fact recorded, directly above a chart of that same activity's step cadence and splits that added up to a distance the page refused to show. A device that records speed but no distance at all, such as a treadmill, now gets a distance derived from its speed, by the same arithmetic the splits already used.
- **Speed and cadence recorded on a ride or run are charted again**, and the metrics list no longer advertises figures the activity was never going to have — "Wheelchair pushes" and "Floors climbed" on a bike ride, permanently "Not available". A metric now appears when it has a value, or when its absence is worth reporting for that kind of activity; a value that was actually recorded is never hidden.
- Fix the large empty gap above and below the recording dashboard, which in outdoor mode's black background read as a broken screen.
- Fix the crash when importing an offline map pack or a large Apple Health export. The file picker read the whole file into memory before the import began, so a 205 MB pack ran out of memory before any import code ran.
- Fix adding a home-screen widget: the metric widget opened the beverage picker (and vice versa), the picker could crash after a selection, and the widget was sometimes never created at all.

## 2.0.1 - 2026-07-11

- **Your Health Connect data is not affected by this update.** Health Connect stores it outside OpenVitals, so the rewrite cannot touch it: steps, sleep, workouts, heart rate, hydration, and every other record stay exactly as they are.
- **Two app settings reset:** the dashboard tile order, and the beverage picked in the quick-beverage home-screen widget. Set them again after updating. A one-time migration carries the rest across automatically — goals, units, theme, the caffeine profile, the body and heart-rate profile, reminders, custom drinks, paired Bluetooth LE sensors, activity marker notes, offline map packs, and your logged beverages.
- Rebuild OpenVitals on Flutter. Same app, same features, same Health Connect data — and the foundation for an iOS version later. The package name and signing certificate are unchanged, so it installs as a normal update.
- **Activity splits.** Any activity with a distance is broken into segments — 1 km by default, configurable in Settings — showing pace, average heart rate, elevation, and how each segment compares to the activity's own average. Laps recorded by a watch are shown exactly as recorded; an activity with no per-time distance data is split evenly and labelled as an estimate rather than presented as a measurement.
- Make Apple Health imports much faster on large exports by skipping records in categories you did not select, and show real progress while the export is scanned instead of sitting at 0%.
- Fix missing heart rate at the start of a recorded activity.
- Fix the dashboard showing the default daily goals instead of yours, the beverage breakdown showing the app's package name instead of drink names, the missing beverage list in the Day view, and the metric carousel refusing to swipe after a tile was moved between pages.
- Share sanitized diagnostics logs directly from Settings.
- **Reminders may now arrive a few minutes later than the time you set.** Google restricts exact alarms to alarm-clock and calendar apps, so hydration and mindfulness reminders are delivered within a short window instead of on the dot.
