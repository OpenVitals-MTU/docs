# Offline Maps Support

> **Status:** Current implemented behavior.
> **Audience:** Users and contributors.
> **Implementation:** `features/activity/maps`, `features/manualentry/activity/recording`, `features/settings`.
> **Navigation:** activity recording and route preview flows; settings import controls.
> **Related:** [Feature map](feature-map.md), [Add offline maps](../how-to/offline-maps.md), [GPX/KML/KMZ route import](route-file-import.md).

Offline maps let activity routes render without app-level internet access.

For detailed download, import, and troubleshooting steps, see [Add offline maps](../how-to/offline-maps.md).

## Map Pack Import

Map packs are imported from Settings. OpenVitals supports:

- PMTiles packs compatible with the app's offline map renderer.
- Mapsforge `.map` or `.maps` packs.

Large imports can continue in the background and show progress through a notification.

## Where Maps Are Used

Imported offline maps can be used for:

- Activity recording map views.
- Saved activity route previews.
- Imported route previews before saving.

The map view rotates under two fingers in both renderers; a compass appears whenever the map is off north and resets it. While recording, the camera keeps the live fix centred: panning hands control to the user, and the recenter button hands it back. Outside a recording, recenter fits the route.

## Local Storage

Imported map packs stay local on the device. They are app support data, not Health Connect records. Removing an imported pack removes the local map source without deleting Health Connect activities.
