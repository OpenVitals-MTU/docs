# Manual Entry Of Metrics

> **Status:** Current implemented behavior.
> **Audience:** Users and contributors.
> **Implementation:** `features/manualentry` and child packages for activity, hydration, nutrition, body, vitals, and mindfulness.
> **Navigation:** `Screen.ManualEntry` and manual entry routes; widgets in `ManualEntryWidgetId`.
> **Related:** [Feature map](feature-map.md), [Permissions](../app/permissions.md), [Beverage logging and caffeine](beverage-logging-and-caffeine.md).

Manual entry flows let the user write explicit records to Health Connect. OpenVitals does not keep a separate health database for these records. The one exception is the cycle day log: what Health Connect has no record type for, such as pain, mood, energy, symptoms, and notes, stays in a journal on the phone, see [Cycle tracking](cycle-tracking.md).

## Weight

Weight is a core manual metric flow. The user enters a value and saves it to Health Connect. OpenVitals-created weight entries can later be edited or deleted when the app has the required write permission. Weight data also feeds body detail screens, BMI, body composition context, and statistics.

## Supported Manual Entries

OpenVitals supports explicit logging for:

- Beverages/hydration, including drink/container choices, custom amounts, caffeine-aware presets, and selected nutrition defaults.
- Foods from a catalog you build yourself, each portion saved as one nutrition record, see [Food logging](food-logging.md).
- Nutrition totals typed in directly: calories in, protein, carbs and fat on one form, plus any other nutrient Health Connect stores (fibre, sugar, fats, vitamins, minerals) added with **Add another nutrient**. One save writes one Health Connect nutrition record; blank fields are left out, and the date and time can be set back to log earlier days. Caffeine is not offered, because it is logged as a drink. Amounts do not change with the unit system: energy in kcal, the macros in grams, and vitamins and minerals in the mg or µg a nutrition label uses. These entries are not drinks, so the beverage screens skip them, and they can be edited from the [Nutrition](nutrition.md) screen.
- Activity sessions, optionally with routes, distance, elevation, calories, repetitions, title, and notes.
- Mindfulness sessions through a timer or manual duration.
- Body measurements such as weight, height, and body fat.
- Vitals such as blood pressure, SpO2, respiratory rate, body temperature, and heart rate variability (HRV).
- Cycle observations through a chooser: bleeding, how you feel, a pregnancy test, an ovulation test, sexual activity, basal body temperature, and cervical mucus, one at a time, saved as one day log.
- Every vitals form offers date and time pickers when adding as well as when editing, defaulting to now - a reading can be logged after the fact under the moment it was taken.

## Permission Handling

The Log screen opens with any or no write access. Each entry form checks only the write permissions its own metric needs; when they are missing it shows a "Some permissions are missing" callout whose Grant button asks Health Connect for exactly those. Write permissions can also be granted from the "Manual entry write access" card in Settings. The dashboard remains read-only even if write permissions have already been granted.

## External Records

Records created by other apps stay read-only in OpenVitals. OpenVitals checks ownership before allowing edits or deletes of records it created.
